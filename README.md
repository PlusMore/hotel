## Branching model
We follow this(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), but use pull requests instead of -no-ff merges. This is for peer code review and easy to find info on Github. 

With maintaining a qa-copy, dev-copy, an production copy, this just makes things easier, and having a common resource reduces the learning curve as some devs are already familiar with the pattern.

## Versioning
How do you know what version number you should be updating to?

http://semver.org/

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

In an application, this generally means more of the following: 
MAJOR version when we decide it's time because the application changes in a significant way,
MINOR version when you add a feature, and
PATCH version when you make bug fixes.

Major version needs the most explanation. An example of when we might do it is if we were to make device into a thin wrapper for iframes, and separate different pages into multiple apps. Another reason might be to align with a business strategy.
